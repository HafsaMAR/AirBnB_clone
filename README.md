## AirBnB Clone Console
Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Console! This is where you begin to create the AirBnB clone project, a complete web app that replicates some features of the well-known lodging rental service, Airbnb.

## Overview
The AirBnB Clone Console is a CLI tool written in Python that lets you manage different kinds of AirBnB objects, such as users, states, cities, places, and more. You can use this console to do various tasks on these objects, such as create, read, update, and delete them.

Also, as part of the development of the command line interpreter along with the backend and file storage system, you can do the following actions:

Make new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place) Get an object from a file, a database etc… Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…) Change attributes of an object Delete an object

## - Usage:

The console provides a set of commands to interact with the AirBnB objects. Here are some of the available commands:

help: Display a list of documented commands and their descriptions.
quit: Exit the console.
Please refer to the AirBnB concept page for more details on the supported objects and their functionalities.
